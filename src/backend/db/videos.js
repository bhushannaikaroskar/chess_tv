World Chess Champion Magnus Carlsen heads the field, which includes stars such as 2020 Champion Fabiano Caruana, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, Anish Giri and 17-year-old Alireza Firouzja. The time control is 100 minutes for 40 moves followed by 50 minutes for 20 moves, then 15 minutes for the rest of the game, with a 30-second increment per move from move 1. If there is a tie for first place the top two after tiebreaks then play a 2-game blitz (5+3) playoff and, if still tied, an Armageddon game. The monetary prizes will be shared evenly.",

World Chess Champion Magnus Carlsen tops the 16-player field, which will be cut in half by the 4-day round-robin Prelims. The total prize fund is $150,000, with $750 for a win and $250 for a draw in the Prelims. The quarterfinals and semi-finals are 1-day, 4-game matches, while the final will feature two such matches over two days. The players have 15 minutes for all their moves, plus a 10-second increment starting from move 1. In the Prelims there are 3 points for a win and 1 for a draw. If a tiebreak is required the players will play two 5+3 games and then, if needed, a single Armageddon game, where White has 5 minutes to Black's 4, but a draw counts as a win for Black. No draw offers are allowed before move 40.",

            "The endgame in chess is when most of the pieces (Queens, Rooks, Knights, Bishops) have been traded off.  At this point in a chess game there is usually only pawns, the kings, and maybe a few pieces on each side.  There are three principles which are vital to understand if you want to be able to win the game at the endgame.  The first is that you must activate your king.  The second is that pawns are much more valuable than at the start of the game. And the third is that passed pawns are the most important of all.  If you can turn a passed pawn into a queen, it will most surely mean victory at such a late stage in a chess game.  In this video I cover all of the chess endgame principles so you can improve and win more games.",
